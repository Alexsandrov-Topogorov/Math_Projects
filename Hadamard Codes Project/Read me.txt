This project was about the hadamard codes encryption method that is based on Hadamard matrices to retreive data portions of noised data after being sent through some channel.
This encryption meethod was originally used on the Mariner2 satelite program sent by NASA in 1962 to retrive images about Venus.
This Folder contains the following elements:
1- Cosmic Encryption: A total report of the project with a comprehensive introduction to the theory behind the Hadamard codes
2- Mariner Code: the Python program for the simulation of the method
3- Pictures: the pictures used in during the testing of the program
