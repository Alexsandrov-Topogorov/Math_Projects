Hello Sir, I hope this message finds you well

This is only to let you know that the pictures found in this folder are to be put on the same directory as the source code's
or you could simply use the whole path of the pictures you want to use instead
note that the decoding process takes quite some time and for the pictures provided (Mariner 4 and Mariner 10) the times were respectively
11.47min and 9.43min

Thank you for your time and attention Sir
